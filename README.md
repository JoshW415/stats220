# stats220
*This is the first time I have used markdown.*

## This is made for a statistics project I am doing as of March 2023

### Here are some of the things that I am learning and practising

* Italics
* Bold
* Links
* Bullet points/lists
* Headers

### How I am going to finish this project

1. Look at the project instructions
2. Get confused and look at the lectures and labs
3. Write some code
4. **Drink some coffee** (very important) <!--- Look its bold --->
5. Go back to step 1

*P.S I think my teacher likes cats, lets try to get some more marks.*
