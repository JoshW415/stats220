*This is the first time I have used markdown.*

## This is made for a stastics project in March 2023

### Here are some of the things I am learning and practising

* Italics
* Bold
* Links
* Bullet points/lists
* Headers

### **Just spent 15 minutes trying to learn what ordered bullet points are**

How I am going to finish this project

1. Look at the project instructions
2. Get confused and look at the lectures and labs
3. Write some code
4. **Drink some coffee** (very important)
5. Go back to 1

*P.S I think my teacher likes cats, lets try to get some more marks.*
